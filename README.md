# Steps

4. Write your data description under the header "Data description" in `index.Rmd`. A data description should tell the reader the source of the data, and detail the structure of the data, including variables and their types, time frame of collection, collection methods. 

5. Brainstorm what questions might be possible to answer with this data (and only this data). Articulate three questions, that you will then answer with your analysis. 

6. In the section on expected findings, for each of your chosen questions, which needs to be completed BEFORE doing your data analysis. For your chosen questions explain what you think you might find, e.g. bee colonies might have more stressors in the hot, humid summer months.

7. One discussion (recommended where you discuss potential questions and findings) with your assignment buddy needs to be conducted and recorded with zoom. About 5-10 minutes is sufficient. The recording needs to be uploaded to Moodle.  

8. Finish your report, which should be structured as follows
    - Introduction and motivation: Give the bigger picture of the data, and inspire the reader to learn more about the problem by reading your analysis. 
    - Data description, details given in 4.
    - Questions of interest (details given in 5)
    - Expected findings (details given in 6)
    - Analysis and Findings, which includes at least one plot or numerical summary for each of your questions, that helps the reader arrive at an answer. You should also write paragraphs describing the methods, summaries and findings. 
    - References that should include R packages used, source of the data, methods used for the analysis.
    - You can have an appendix, that contains extra information that you think might be useful for the reader but not important enough to be in the main document.
    - **Your final report should be in the `main` branch.**

9. Give access to your github repo to the two students providing peer feedback, list will be available here, after assignment submission date.

10.  Provide peer feedback on assigned report. You will be randomly assigned another team's report, and be expected to reproduce their analysis, and provide constructive input on the analysis. The purpose of peer feedback is to learn how other analysts approach problems, and to help improve other analysts analyses.
